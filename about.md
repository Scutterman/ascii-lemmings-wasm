# About

Ascii Lemmings is an experiment in creating a Lemmings clone in [Assemblyscript](https://assemblyscript.org/), which uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) tooling and syntax but generates a [Web Assembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly) wasm file instead of a javascript file.
